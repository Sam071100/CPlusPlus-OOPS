// Polymorphism in C++
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    /*
     Polymorphism 'Poly-> Many' and 'Morphism-> Forms' means multiple forms
         - one name and multiple forms
         - Function overloading, Operator overloading, Virtual Functions
         - Compile time polymorphism, runtime polymorphism

     Polymorphism in C++ can be of two types:
       1. Compile time polymorphism
          Compile time polymorphism in C++ is acheived using:
            1.1 - Function Overloading
            1.2 - Operator Overloading
            " Decision is taken b1y the compiler and binding of the object to the address of the function is done during the compile time and it is often called Early Binding"
       2. Run time polymorphism
          Run time polymorphism in C++ is achieved using
            2.1 - Virtual function
            " Desicion is taken late during the run time and it is often called Late Binding"
